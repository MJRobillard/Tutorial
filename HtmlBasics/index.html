      <p>NARRATOR:
        (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
        According to all known laws
        of aviation,
         :
        there is no way a bee
        should be able to fly.
         :
        Its wings are too small to get
        its fat little body off the ground.
         :
        The bee, of course, flies anyway
         :
        because bees don't care
        what humans think is impossible.
        BARRY BENSON:
        (Barry is picking out a shirt)
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
         :
        Ooh, black and yellow!
        Let's shake it up a little.
        JANET BENSON:
        Barry! Breakfast is ready!
        BARRY:
        Coming!
         :
        Hang on a second.
        (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
         :
        Hello?
        ADAM FLAYMAN:
        
        (Through phone)
        - Barry?
        BARRY:
        - Adam?
        ADAM:
        - Can you believe this is happening?
        BARRY:
        - I can't. I'll pick you up.
        (Barry flies down the stairs)
         :
        MARTIN BENSON:
        Looking sharp.
        JANET:
        Use the stairs. Your father
        paid good money for those.
        BARRY:
        Sorry. I'm excited.
        MARTIN:
        Here's the graduate.
        We're very proud of you, son.
         :
        A perfect report card, all B's.
        JANET:
        Very proud.
        (Rubs Barry's hair)
        BARRY=
        Ma! I got a thing going here.
        JANET:
        - You got lint on your fuzz.
        BARRY:
        - Ow! That's me!
        
        JANET:
        - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
        - Bye!
        (Barry flies out the door)
        JANET:
        Barry, I told you,
        stop flying in the house!
        (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
        newspaper)
        BARRY==
        - Hey, Adam.
        ADAM:
        - Hey, Barry.
        (Adam gets in Barry's car)
         :
        - Is that fuzz gel?
        BARRY:
        - A little. Special day, graduation.
        ADAM:
        Never thought I'd make it.
        (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
        BARRY:
        Three days grade school,
        three days high school...
        ADAM:
        Those were awkward.
        BARRY:
        Three days college. I'm glad I took
        a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
        ADAM==
        You did come back different.
        (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
        ARTIE:
        - Hi, Barry!
        
        BARRY:
        - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
        ADAM:
        - Hear about Frankie?
        BARRY:
        - Yeah.
        ADAM==
        - You going to the funeral?
        BARRY:
        - No, I'm not going to his funeral.
         :
        Everybody knows,
        sting someone, you die.
         :
        Don't waste it on a squirrel.
        Such a hothead.
        ADAM:
        I guess he could have
        just gotten out of the way.
        (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
        highway)
         :
        I love this incorporating
        an amusement park into our regular day.
        BARRY:
        I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
        (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
        students)
        Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
        under the circumstances.
        (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
         :
        - Well, Adam, today we are men.
        
        ADAM:
        - We are!
        BARRY=
        - Bee-men.
        =ADAM=
        - Amen!
        BARRY AND ADAM:
        Hallelujah!
        (Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)
